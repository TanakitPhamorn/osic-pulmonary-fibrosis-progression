1. Should I mask the lung pictures
	Masking gives you more detailed images
	Not masking NOW is giving you better score
2. Are there anyway that we can use both images and text for modelling at the same time.
3. Can we do K-fold cross validation for this model?
4. How many layers should we use for CNN model
5. What loss function and metrics that we should use.
	Now I use 1.mean_squared_logarithmic_error with MSE and 2.mean_squared_error with RMSE
